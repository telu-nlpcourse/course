# Preamble
This repository contains the lecture slides and course description for the Natural Language Processing course offered in 2017/2018 2nd term at the Telkom University. 

This is an introductory course on natural language processing. The NLP topic deals with the interaction between human and computer, and the ultimate goal is that computer could understand the command delivered in human natural language. The biggest challenge in processing natural language is ambiguity. Ambiguity found in each level of language complexity, from the lexical until pragmatic level. This course objective includes the student ability to design and evaluate a system that is based on lexical, syntactic, and semantic level of language processing, and to design - implement - evaluate an NLP based system for a real problem.

## Lectures
Lectures are held in KU3.09.17 room on Tuesdays, 08:30-11:00. Each meeting will contains three sections:

1. Student presentation, 15-30', each student will be given chance to deliver a part of the topic of the week using their own style.
2. Course material presentation by lecturer, 30-45'.
3. Hands-on on paper-pencil based exercise or live programming.

# Lecture Materials
